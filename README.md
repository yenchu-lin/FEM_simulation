# Fixational Eye Movement Control Exploratory Project 
Testing the goodness of eye trajectory in visual discrimination and exploring the benefit of fixational eye movements in visual perception

The model is a tool to help designing human psychophysics experiments. The model uses measured human eye trajectories to determine motion of the retinal input, and makes links to neural processing and perception using a low level vision model and a Bsaysian decision model. 

There are three stages involved --
1. Retinal input based on the visual stimulus and eye trajectoriea
2. Neural coding - using spatiotemporal filtering properties of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus to simulate firing profiles
3. Decision process - using a Bayesian model, inclduing probability distribution approximating and maximum a posterior probability likelihood calculation

To run the code --
See femc_1run_simulation.m to setup input conditions
