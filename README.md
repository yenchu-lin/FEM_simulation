Goodness of eye trajectory for visual discrimination - exploring the benefit of fixational eye movements in visual perception

The model is an exploratory tool to help designing human psychophysics expriemnts. The model uses measured human eye trajectories to determine motion of the retinal input, and makes links to neural processing and perception using a low level vision model and a Bsaysian decision model.
